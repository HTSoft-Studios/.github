# Let's introduce ourselves.

We're a small development agency that works on influential programs, such like ``Codename Twily`` and ``Battles of Batch``. We're into full-stack development and we can't care less about making our programs as professional as we could. We make sure that we try to deliver a smooth and premium experience without waiting too long. If you're looking to contact us, we have many methods of doing so. You could contact us with our business [e-mail](mailto:contact@htssoft.tk) or by joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/65cCdsHe5k) with other members who are into coding and using our programs.

## Progression & Development

With our creative mindsets. We think something that can do an impact for someone who needed it the most. We can't say when we're developing something. That's due to the slow progression we're having due to the distances. Everyone who works with us either lives in a different country or different city. Either both, we still try our best to deliver anything as soon as possible.

## Team

We're currently in an amount of six agents. All who wan't and rely interest in HTS Studios and its progression. Negativity or even worse than that will mainly stop our development. We always wan't to do something either outside or at home on our computers.
